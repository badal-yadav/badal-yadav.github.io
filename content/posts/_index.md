I am Badal 🙏", img = "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6d/db/9a/6ddb9a8510b62de75437eb6266a41345.jpg", text = "Badal is kind, caring and timid, but also demanding, calculating, and ruthless. His invented pseudonym, Heisenberg, becomes an alter ego – a fantasy for him to live out a love of power. Beneath both sides of his dual personality, he views the world in the rarefied scientific terms of chemistry."}
