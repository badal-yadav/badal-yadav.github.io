I am Badal 🙏", img = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5a/f4/43/5af443207f83588e27489d2e44d03fba.jpg", text = "Badal is kind, caring and timid, but also demanding, calculating, and ruthless. His invented pseudonym, Heisenberg, becomes an alter ego – a fantasy for him to live out a love of power. Beneath both sides of his dual personality, he views the world in the rarefied scientific terms of chemistry."}
